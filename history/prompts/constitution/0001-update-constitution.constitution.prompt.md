The Evolution of Todo

Preamble

This Constitution establishes the governing principles, standards, and invariants for The Evolution of Todo — a multi-phase educational software project demonstrating the evolution of a simple CLI todo application into a cloud-native, AI-powered, event-driven distributed system.

Core Purpose: To teach students modern software engineering through Spec-Driven Development (SDD) and AI-assisted implementation, where humans act as architects and AI (Claude Code) performs all coding work.

Scope of Authority: This Constitution applies to ALL phases, ALL features, ALL specifications, ALL plans, ALL tasks, and ALL implementations across the entire project lifecycle.

Supremacy Clause: If any specification, plan, task, or implementation conflicts with this Constitution, THE CONSTITUTION WINS. The conflicting artifact must be rewritten or regenerated.

I. Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. Spec-Driven Development Only

Mandate: All feature development must follow the strict SDD workflow:

/sp.constitution → /sp.specify → /sp.plan → /sp.tasks → /sp.implement


Rules:

No feature may be implemented without a complete, approved specification

Humans may NOT manually write feature code

If generated code is incorrect, refine the SPEC, not the code

All specifications are versioned and stored in specs/

Every spec must include clear acceptance criteria and test scenarios

Violations: Any manually-written feature code is considered non-compliant and must be regenerated through the SDD workflow.

2. AI as Primary Developer

Division of Responsibilities:

Humans Must:

Write and refine feature specifications

Review architectural decisions

Run and validate tests

Approve changes before merge

Make final decisions on tradeoffs

AI (Claude Code) Must:

Generate architecture plans from specs

Write all implementation code

Create comprehensive test suites

Perform refactoring and bug fixes

Document all generated artifacts

Accountability: All AI-generated code is traceable to the human-written specification that authorized it.

3. Mandatory Traceability

Requirement: Every feature must maintain a complete audit trail:

Architecture Decision Record (ADR) — Why this approach?

Specification — What are we building?

Architecture Plan — How will we build it?

Task Breakdown — What are the specific implementation steps?

Implementation — The generated code

Test Suite — Verification of correctness

Linkage: All artifacts must cross-reference each other. ADRs link to specs, specs link to plans, plans link to tasks, tasks link to implementations.

Storage:

ADRs → history/adr/
Specs → specs/<feature>/spec.md
Plans → specs/<feature>/plan.md
Tasks → specs/<feature>/tasks.md
PHRs → history/prompts/
Code → src/ (Phase I) or frontend/, backend/ (Phase II+)
Tests → tests/ (Phase I) or frontend/tests/, backend/tests/ (Phase II+)

4. Test-First Mandate

Requirement: Testing is NOT optional.

Rules:

Tests must be generated before or immediately after implementation

Every feature must have integration tests covering user journeys

Unit tests required for complex business logic

All tests must pass before marking a feature complete

Test coverage must be maintained across refactoring

Minimum 80% code coverage target for Phase II+

Test Types by Phase:

Phase I (CLI or console): Integration tests for command flows, unit tests for core logic

Phase II (Web): API integration tests (contract testing), React component tests, E2E user journeys, authentication flow tests, user isolation tests (security critical)

Phase III+ (Distributed): Contract tests, integration tests, chaos testing

5. Evolutionary Consistency

Principle: Later phases extend but never break earlier phases.

Rules:

Phase II must support all Phase I functionality

Phase III must preserve Phase I and II semantics

Breaking changes require explicit ADR and migration plan

Domain model extensions are additive only

Verification: Regression test suites from earlier phases must continue to pass.

II. Domain Model Governance

Global Todo Domain Rules

Base Model (Phase I - Immutable):

Todo:
 - id: unique identifier
 - title: short description
 - description: detailed text (optional)
 - completed: boolean status


Phase II Extensions (Additive):

 - user_id: foreign key to users table (REQUIRED for multi-user support)
 - created_at: timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
 - updated_at: timestamp (ISO 8601 format)


Intermediate Extensions (Phase II - Optional/Future):

 - priority: enum (low, medium, high)
 - tags: list of strings
 - category: single classification


Advanced Extensions (Phase III+ - Additive):

 - due_date: optional deadline
 - recurrence: optional repeat pattern
 - reminders: list of reminder configs
 - assigned_to: user/agent reference
 - parent_id: for subtasks


Invariants:

id is immutable once assigned

user_id is immutable once assigned (Phase II+)

completed is boolean; no intermediate states

State transitions are explicit and logged

All timestamps use ISO 8601 format

All field additions must maintain backward compatibility

Semantic Consistency:

"Creating a todo" has the same meaning in CLI or console, Web UI, API, and AI agent

"Marking complete" follows identical rules across all interfaces

Search/filter/sort behavior is consistent across all phases

III. Technology Governance

Enforcement: No alternative structures permitted. All new phases must follow this layout.V. Quality Standards (Global)

Specification quality: clear problem statement, user stories, edge cases, performance, security, success metrics

Code quality: clean, readable, DRY, minimal complexity, logging, error handling

Documentation: versioned, README.md, CLAUDE.md, inline comments, API and DB docs

VI. Security & Compliance

Universal: input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS/CSRF protection, secrets management, HTTPS/TLS

Data privacy: minimal collection, retention policies, secure deletion, privacy-by-design

Forbidden: plaintext passwords, trusting client-side validation, sensitive data leaks, deprecated crypto

VII. Phase Evolution Rules

Phase transition: previous phase complete, ADR exists, migration plan, regression tests pass

Phase independence: each phase deployable independently

Evolution path:

Phase I: CLI or console

Phase II: Full-Stack Web

Phase III: AI-Powered

Phase IV: Cloud-Native Distributed

Phase V: Enterprise Features

VIII. Workflow Enforcement

SDD Workflow: Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Record

ADR creation rules: impact, alternatives, scope (all three must be yes)

Violations invalidate the work

IX. Human-AI Collaboration Contract

Humans: architect, spec author, QA, review

AI: generate code, tests, refactor, document

Escalation: AI must ask clarifying questions, present trade-offs, or surface blockers

AI cannot auto-approve, skip testing, or make architecture decisions alone

X. Academic & Professional Integrity

Code originates from AI, guided by human specs

No plagiarism, all work reproducible

Attribution: mark AI-generated code, cite references

Educational value: students gain architecture, specification, and collaboration skills

XI. Versioning & Change Management

Constitution amendments: propose → ADR → approval → version bump

Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Spec versioning: immutable, new version on changes, link to superseded versions

XII. Governance & Enforcement

Supremacy: Constitution > ADRs > Specs > Plans > Tasks > Implementation

Compliance: verify spec, plan, tasks, ADRs, tests, code review, PHRs

Enforcement: pre-commit hooks, CI/CD, AI agents refuse non-compliant requests

Review: monthly PHR/ADR audit, quarterly Constitution review, annual phase evolution assessment

XIII. Final Authority

Ratification: effective immediately

Amendment: requires ADR, justification, explicit approval

Interpretation: guided by SDD and human-AI collaboration principles

Non-compliance: work violating the Constitution must be rejected and regenerated
```

## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to implement "The Evolution of Todo" constitution with comprehensive governance principles for Spec-Driven Development. Key changes included:

1. Implemented all 13 sections of the new constitution (Core Principles, Domain Model Governance, Technology Governance, Repository Structure, Quality Standards, Security & Compliance, Phase Evolution Rules, Workflow Enforcement, Human-AI Collaboration Contract, Academic Integrity, Versioning, Governance & Enforcement, Final Authority)

2. Updated template files to align with new constitution:
   - Modified `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` to include Constitution Check with specific compliance requirements
   - Updated `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` to reflect mandatory testing and traceability requirements

3. Created Sync Impact Report documenting the version change from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0 and template updates

4. Maintained all constitutional requirements including Spec-Driven Development workflow, AI as Primary Developer, Mandatory Traceability, Test-First Mandate, and Evolutionary Consistency

## Outcome
