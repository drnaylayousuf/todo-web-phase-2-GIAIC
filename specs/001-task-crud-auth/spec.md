# Feature Specification: Task CRUD Operations with Authentication
Feature Branch: `001-task-crud-auth`
Created: 2026-01-03
Status: Draft
Input: User description: "Task CRUD Operations with Authentication (Web Version) - Full-stack web application for managing personal tasks with user authentication, supporting create, read, update, delete operations with user data isolation."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Registration (Priority: P1)

As a new user, I want to sign up with email and password so I can create an account and start managing my tasks.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for all other features. Without user accounts, no personalized task management is possible. This is the entry point to the application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing registration page, submitting valid email/password, and verifying account creation. Delivers immediate value by allowing users to create accounts and access the system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the registration page, **When** I enter a valid email (proper format) and password (minimum 8 characters), **Then** my account is created with a unique ID, password is hashed with bcrypt, and I am redirected to the login page with a success message
2. **Given** I am on the registration page, **When** I enter an invalid email format, **Then** I see an error message "Please enter a valid email address"
3. **Given** I am on the registration page, **When** I enter a password with fewer than 8 characters, **Then** I see an error message "Password must be at least 8 characters"
4. **Given** I am on the registration page, **When** I try to register with an email that already exists, **Then** I see an error message "An account with this email already exists"

---

### User Story 2 - User Login (Priority: P1)

As a registered user, I want to log in with my credentials so I can access my personal task dashboard.

**Why this priority**: Critical authentication gate. Users must be able to authenticate before accessing any task management features. Directly depends on User Story 1.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing login page, entering valid credentials, and verifying JWT token issuance and redirection to dashboard. Delivers value by allowing registered users to access their personal workspace.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the login page with valid credentials, **When** I submit my email and password, **Then** I receive a JWT token (stored securely in httpOnly cookie), and I am redirected to my task dashboard
2. **Given** I am on the login page, **When** I enter incorrect credentials, **Then** I see an error message "Invalid email or password" and remain on the login page
3. **Given** I am on the login page, **When** I enter an email that doesn't exist in the system, **Then** I see an error message "Invalid email or password" (same message to prevent email enumeration)
4. **Given** I am logged in with a valid JWT token, **When** I close and reopen the browser within 7 days, **Then** I remain authenticated and can access my dashboard

---

### User Story 3 - View All My Tasks (Priority: P2)

As a logged-in user, I want to view all my tasks so I can see what needs to be done.

**Why this priority**: Core read operation. Once users can authenticate, viewing their tasks is the first interaction with the task management system. Essential for users to understand their current workload.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, navigating to dashboard, and verifying only user's own tasks are displayed. Delivers value by showing users their personal task list with proper data isolation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in and have created 5 tasks, **When** I access my dashboard, **Then** I see all 5 of my tasks displayed, sorted by creation date (newest first), showing title, description, completion status, and created date
2. **Given** I am logged in and have not created any tasks, **When** I access my dashboard, **Then** I see an empty state message "You don't have any tasks yet. Create your first task to get started!"
3. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I view my tasks, **Then** I ONLY see tasks associated with my user_id (no other users' tasks are visible)
4. **Given** I am logged in and have both completed and incomplete tasks, **When** I view my task list, **Then** completed tasks are visually distinguished (strikethrough text or checkmark icon)

---

### User Story 4 - Create New Task (Priority: P2)

As a logged-in user, I want to create a new task with a title and optional description so I can track things I need to do.

**Why this priority**: Core create operation. Users need to add tasks to populate their task list. This is the primary way users input data into the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, clicking "Create Task", filling form, and verifying task appears in task list. Delivers immediate value by allowing users to capture tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I fill in a title (1-200 characters) and description (up to 1000 characters) and submit, **Then** the task is saved to the database with my user_id, creation timestamp, and appears at the top of my task list
2. **Given** I am on the create task form, **When** I submit with an empty title, **Then** I see an error message "Title is required"
3. **Given** I am on the create task form, **When** I enter a title longer than 200 characters, **Then** I see an error message "Title must be 200 characters or less"
4. **Given** I am on the create task form, **When** I leave the description empty, **Then** the task is created successfully with no description (description is optional)
5. **Given** I create a new task, **When** the task is saved, **Then** the created_at and updated_at timestamps are automatically set to the current time

---

### User Story 5 - Mark Task Complete/Incomplete (Priority: P3)

As a logged-in user, I want to toggle a task's completion status with a single click so I can track my progress.

**Why this priority**: Primary interaction for task status management. Users need quick, easy way to mark tasks done. High-frequency action that must be frictionless.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, clicking completion toggle on a task, and verifying visual change and persistence. Delivers value by allowing users to track completed work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an incomplete task, **When** I click the completion toggle, **Then** the task is marked as complete, visual indicator shows completion (strikethrough, checkmark), updated_at timestamp is updated, and change is persisted to database
2. **Given** I have a completed task, **When** I click the completion toggle, **Then** the task is marked as incomplete, visual indicators are removed, updated_at timestamp is updated, and change is persisted
3. **Given** I toggle a task's completion status, **When** I refresh the page, **Then** the completion status persists
4. **Given** I attempt to toggle a task that doesn't belong to me, **Then** the action is denied with a 404 error (not 403 to prevent information leakage)

---

### User Story 6 - Update Task (Priority: P3)

As a logged-in user, I want to edit a task's title or description so I can correct mistakes or add details.

**Why this priority**: Core update operation. Users need ability to modify tasks as requirements change. Less frequent than viewing or creating, but still essential.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, clicking edit on a task, modifying fields, and verifying changes are saved. Delivers value by allowing users to keep task information current.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing my tasks, **When** I click edit on a task, modify the title and/or description, and save, **Then** the changes are persisted to the database and updated_at timestamp is updated
2. **Given** I am editing a task, **When** I clear the title and try to save, **Then** I see an error message "Title is required"
3. **Given** I am editing a task, **When** I enter a title longer than 200 characters, **Then** I see an error message "Title must be 200 characters or less"
4. **Given** I attempt to update a task that doesn't belong to me, **When** I submit changes, **Then** the action is denied with a 404 error
5. **Given** I successfully update a task, **When** I view my task list, **Then** I see the updated information immediately

---

### User Story 7 - Delete Task (Priority: P4)

As a logged-in user, I want to permanently delete a task so I can remove tasks I no longer need.

**Why this priority**: Core delete operation. Less frequent than other operations but necessary for task list maintenance. Lowest priority because users can work around by leaving tasks incomplete.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, clicking delete on a task, confirming deletion, and verifying task is removed. Delivers value by allowing users to clean up task lists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing my tasks, **When** I click delete on a task, **Then** I see a confirmation dialog "Are you sure you want to delete this task? This action cannot be undone."
2. **Given** I see the delete confirmation dialog, **When** I confirm deletion, **Then** the task is permanently removed from the database and disappears from my task list with a success message "Task deleted successfully"
3. **Given** I see the delete confirmation dialog, **When** I cancel, **Then** the task is not deleted and I return to my task list
4. **Given** I attempt to delete a task that doesn't belong to me, **When** I submit the deletion, **Then** the action is denied with a 404 error
5. **Given** I delete a task, **When** I refresh the page, **Then** the task remains deleted (deletion is permanent)

## Edge Cases

### Authentication & Authorization:

- What happens when a JWT token expires while user is actively using the application? (Session expires after 7 days, user is redirected to login with message "Your session has expired. Please log in again.")
- What happens when a user tries to access protected routes without authentication? (Redirected to login page)
- What happens when a user manipulates the user_id in the URL to access another user's tasks? (Returns 404 error, no data exposed)

### Data Validation:

- What happens when title is exactly 200 characters? (Accepted - boundary is inclusive)
- What happens when description is exactly 1000 characters? (Accepted - boundary is inclusive)
- What happens when user enters special characters or HTML in title/description? (Sanitized to prevent XSS, stored safely)
- What happens when user submits form with SQL injection attempt? (Parameterized queries prevent injection, input treated as literal text)

### Concurrency:

- What happens when user updates same task in two different browser tabs? (Last write wins, updated_at reflects most recent change)
- What happens when user deletes a task that's open for editing in another tab? (Edit attempt returns 404 error)

### Network & Performance:

- What happens when API request fails due to network timeout? (User sees error message "Request failed. Please try again.", data not lost if in form)
- What happens when database is temporarily unavailable? (User sees error message "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a moment.")
- What happens when 10,000+ tasks are stored for a single user? (Pagination would be needed, but out of scope for this phase - assume reasonable task counts)

### Data Integrity:

- What happens when user_id in JWT doesn't match any user in database? (Authentication fails, user is logged out)
- What happens when task's user_id becomes orphaned (user deleted)? (Out of scope - user deletion not implemented in this phase)

## Assumptions (optional - include if making decisions without full user input)

### Development Environment
**Assumption**: Developers have Docker and Docker Compose installed locally
**Rationale**: Industry-standard containerization tool, specified in requirements

### Browser Support
**Assumption**: Application supports modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) released within last 2 years
**Rationale**: Standard web development practice, allows use of modern JavaScript/CSS features

### User Behavior
**Assumption**: Individual users will manage between 0-1000 tasks on average
**Rationale**: Reasonable personal task management scope, allows deferring pagination to future phases

### Security Model
**Assumption**: JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies for web application security
**Rationale**: Industry best practice for token storage, prevents XSS token theft

### Email Validation
**Assumption**: Email validation checks format only (regex), not deliverability (no verification email)
**Rationale**: Simplifies initial implementation, email verification can be added in future phase

### Password Policy
**Assumption**: Minimum 8 characters is sufficient password strength requirement for initial phase
**Rationale**: Balances security with user convenience, additional password rules (complexity, history) can be added later

### Data Retention
**Assumption**: User accounts and tasks persist indefinitely (no automatic deletion policy)
**Rationale**: Out of scope for Phase II, data retention policy can be defined in future enterprise phase

### Localization
**Assumption**: Application supports English language only
**Rationale**: Internationalization not specified in requirements, can be added in future phase

### Time Zones
**Assumption**: All timestamps stored in UTC, displayed in user's local time zone
**Rationale**: Standard practice for distributed applications, prevents time zone confusion

### Development Tools
Docker: Containerization platform for local development environment (PostgreSQL, backend, frontend services)
Docker Compose: Multi-container orchestration for local development setup

### Infrastructure Requirements
PostgreSQL 16: Database system supporting UUID generation, foreign key constraints, indexes, and timestamp types
Environment Variable Support: Both frontend and backend must support .env file configuration for secrets and connection strings

## Non-Functional Requirements (optional - include if performance, security, etc. are critical)

### Performance
- API Response Time: All API endpoints must respond in under 200ms under normal load (excluding network latency)
- Database Query Optimization: All foreign key columns (user_id) and frequently queried columns (completed) must be indexed
- Hot Reload Performance: Code changes must reflect in running containers within 3 seconds during development

### Security
- Password Storage: All passwords must be hashed using bcrypt before database storage (no plaintext storage)
- User Data Isolation: ALL database queries must filter by authenticated user's user_id (no cross-user data access)
- Authorization Enforcement: Every protected API endpoint must verify JWT token and extract user_id for authorization
- Error Message Security: Return 404 (not 403) for unauthorized resource access to prevent information leakage
- Input Sanitization: All user input must be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- SQL Injection Prevention: All database queries must use parameterized queries (SQLModel ORM enforces this)

### Reliability
- Data Persistence: Task and user data must persist between container restarts (volume-mounted database)
- Error Recovery: Application must gracefully handle database connection failures with user-friendly error messages
- Session Persistence: JWT tokens must remain valid for full 7-day period unless explicitly invalidated

### Usability
- Empty States: Display helpful empty state messages when users have no tasks
- Confirmation Dialogs: Require explicit confirmation for destructive actions (delete)
- Success Feedback: Show success messages after completing actions (create, update, delete)
- Error Clarity: Validation errors must clearly indicate what went wrong and how to fix it

### Frontend Design & Theme Requirements

- NFR-UI-001: The application MUST use a clean, modern light theme with consistent spacing, rounded corners, and subtle shadows for depth and hierarchy.
- NFR-UI-002: Primary color MUST be a calm, professional blue (#2563EB) used for primary buttons, links, active states, and important interactive elements.
- NFR-UI-003: Secondary/accent color MUST be a soft teal (#14B8A6) for highlights, badges, secondary buttons, and subtle callouts.
- NFR-UI-004: Destructive/error color MUST be a vivid red (#EF4444) used for delete actions, error messages, and critical alerts, accompanied by confirmation dialogs.
- NFR-UI-005: Success color MUST be a vibrant green (#22C55E) for completed tasks, success messages, and confirmation states.
- NFR-UI-006: Background color MUST be a soft off-white (#F9FAFB) for page backgrounds, with cards and modals using pure white (#FFFFFF) for contrast and depth.
- NFR-UI-007: Text color MUST ensure WCAG AA contrast:
  - Primary text: #111827
  - Secondary text: #6B7280
  - Disabled text: #9CA3AF
- NFR-UI-008: Completed tasks MUST be visually muted with lighter text (#9CA3AF), strikethrough styling, and optional subtle checkmark icon.
- NFR-UI-009: Buttons, forms, and inputs MUST have:
  - Rounded corners (4-8px radius)
  - Consistent padding (e.g., 0.5rem vertical, 1rem horizontal)
  - Soft border (#E5E7EB)
  - Hover and focus states with subtle shadows or color transitions
- NFR-UI-010: Interactive elements MUST have smooth transitions (0.2-0.3s) for hover, focus, and active states to improve user experience.
- NFR-UI-011: UI MUST be built using a utility-first CSS framework (Tailwind CSS) to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- NFR-UI-012: Styling MUST be consistent across all pages (authentication, dashboard, task list, modals, alerts), including typography, spacing, and button styles.
- NFR-UI-013: Error messages and validation states MUST be clearly visible, using the error color (#EF4444) and icon indicators where appropriate.
- NFR-UI-014: Success messages MUST be clearly visible, using the success color (#22C55E) with icon indicators where appropriate.
- NFR-UI-015: Completed tasks, inactive buttons, and disabled inputs MUST appear visually muted to indicate lower emphasis.
- NFR-UI-016: No dark mode or theme switching is required in Phase II, but color roles MUST allow future dark mode implementation.

### Maintainability
- Type Safety: TypeScript with strict mode (frontend) and Python type hints (backend) for all code
- Code Coverage: Minimum 80% test coverage for both frontend and backend
- API Documentation: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all backend endpoints
- Environment Portability: Same codebase and database schema must work in both local (Docker PostgreSQL) and production (Neon) environments by changing only DATABASE_URL

### Development Environment
